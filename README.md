## Introduction

Codepedia is designed to be a comprehensive resource for developers of all skill levels, providing valuable information and enhancing coding skills.

## Update 12/6/2024

- Added a Version Control section with new content in the Development area.
- Improved navigation buttons to automatically display when note properties are set, and hide otherwise, with new styling (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Refactored `custom.css` with added comments.
- Enhanced documentation and updated CONTRIBUTING.md.

⚠️ Minor bug: When placing the cursor on the edge of the global navigation buttons, they may not register and navigate to the note. This was **not** introduced in this update and will be fixed in the next update.
