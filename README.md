## Introduction

Codepedia is designed to be a comprehensive resource for developers of all skill levels, providing valuable information and enhancing coding skills.

## Update 12/7/2024

- Added music player in home
- Added start and stop buttons and js scripts for **cat**
- Added new folder in `config/Music/` for any music.
- Added repo protection
- Some other stuff I probably forgot to mention

⚠️ Minor bug: When placing the cursor on the edge of the global navigation buttons, they may not register and navigate to the note. This was **not** introduced in this update and will be fixed asap.
