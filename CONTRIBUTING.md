# Contributing to Codepedia

Thank you for considering contributing to Codepedia! Your help is greatly appreciated. Below are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Custom CSS
Our custom CSS is located in `Codepedia\.obsidian\snippets\custom.css`. Please ensure any new styles are added here.

## Templates
All templates, including newly created ones, should be placed in `Codepedia\Config\Templates`.

## Custom Scripts
Any custom scripts should be stored in `Codepedia\Config\Scripts`.

## Content Contributions
We are always looking for more quality content, especially for the Development section. Please add any new development-related content to `Codepedia\Content\Development`. For other types of content, use the `Codepedia\Content\` directory.

## Plugins
We use numerous plugins to enhance our workflow. One important plugin is the Note Toolbar, which provides stock buttons that our custom CSS targets.

### Tutorial Navigation
For tutorials, walkthroughs, or discussions, use the Tutorial-Nav buttons located in the Note Toolbar. These buttons use the `{{prop_backward}}` and `{{prop_forward}}` variables to specify the previous and next notes in the tutorial sequence. In the note properties, create new properties called backward and forward and set them to the note's filename. Then go to Note Toolbar > Tutorial-Nav > More Options > Copy as callout and paste the callout into the note.

Thank you for your contributions! If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to us.
